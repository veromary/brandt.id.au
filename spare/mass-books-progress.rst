The files are with the printers and they say they can make the Pentecost
deadline. That doesn't leave time for covering and ribboning the books -
maybe that will come after Pentecost.

Donations have been very heartening and we have about half the cost of
printing covered. Thank you to Ann and Maria!

The photos show some draft copies with our team of book testers. We
should get some photos from our other testing ground at Mulgoa. The
books have proven their usefulness in the home and parish settings and
all the refinements from the testing phase have been applied, ready for
action!

So, here is the last week to donate! Next Saturday I'll be taking down
the comical thermometer and thinking up some other mad project.

There is progress happening with `gregorio`_ too so its all looking
sunny in the land of typing up hymns.

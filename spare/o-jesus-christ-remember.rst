Here is one of my favourite hymns of all time. It's written by Fr Edward
Caswall, one of my favourite hymn writers of all time. If it's the image
of Christ's coming in glory "upon the clouds of heaven" or the quiet
image of kneeling before the Blessed Sacrament with Christ as the sole
witness. It's a good hymn for the Ascension of Our Lord too. "This Jesus
Who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall come in the same way
as you have seen Him going up to heaven." Acts 1:11.

O Jesus Christ remember
 When Thou shalt come again
 Upon the clouds of heaven
 With all Thy shining train
 When every eye shall see Thee
 In deity revealed
 Who now upon this altar
 In silence art concealed.

2. Remember then O Saviour
 I supplicate of Thee
 That here I bowed before Thee
 Upon my bended knee
 That here I owned Thy presence
 And did not Thee deny
 And glorified Thy greatness
 Though hid from human eye.

3. Accept divine Redeemer
 The homage of my praise
 Be Thou the light and honour
 And glory of my days
 Be Thou my consolation
 When death is drawing nigh
 Be Thou my only treasure
 Through all eternity.

Edward Caswall, 1814â€“78

A recording from the choir preparing for Fr Terence's anniversary Mass
at St Mary's Cathedral:

My last post was a go at supplying a weekly Mass sheet for children.
This post is a go at a weekly hymn to help keep these treasures alive.

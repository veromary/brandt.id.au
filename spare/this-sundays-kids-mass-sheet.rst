`|The Last Supper|`_\ This Sunday had me stumped. I'm going by the 1962
calendar as we attend a local Extraordinary Form Mass, so Corpus Christi
is today (Thursday) and this Sunday is just 2nd Sunday after Pentecost.

The Gospel tells the story of the man who gave a feast and nobody showed
up. My book didn't have an illustration specific to that story, but
maybe there are enough parallels to the Last Supper to justify this
picture instead. The text is from Psalm 12, the communion antiphon.
 `Pentecost2`_

`|049detail|`_\ There is another source of woodcuts already arranged for
Sundays called `Illustrations of Gospel Stories`_ from Jerome Nadal,
S.J., thanks to Felix Just's `website`_. It has lots of pictures at a
good size for viewing on the internet, but perhaps a tad small for good
prints.

Restored Traditions has put together a collection of `Art for Every
Sunday and Holy Day`_. Full colour classic paintings from all different
periods.

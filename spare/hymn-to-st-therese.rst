|St Therese by Peter Brandt|\ For those who read music:
`HiddenInCarmel.pdf`_ (easy piano)

And for those who use Lilypond: `HiddenInCarmel.ly`_

And for the MIDI fans: `HiddenInCarmel.midi`_

The words come from the last four verses of `a longer hymn`_.

Set to the tune Ave Vera Virginitas by Josquin de Pres, which turns out
to be the tail end of a longer `Ave Maria`_.

I've transposed it right down into a range where everybody can sing it,
but if you want Josquin de Pres's nice floaty sound, take it up to the
key of C. In the lilypond file just comment out the transpose line (down
at the beginning of the score block).

St Therese's feast day is in early October (it was moved around in the
calendar changes so check your local calendar for the precise date).

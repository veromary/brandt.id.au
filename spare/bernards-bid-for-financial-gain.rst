`|DSC01332|`_\ Bernard is six years old, but according to him his
drawings are so good they could have been drawn by a seven year old!
He's prepared to part from them for $2 each (free postage). You can see
he drew inspiration from the Steven Parish book on How To Draw
Australian Sealife.

But that's not all. He also makes Paper Aeroplanes!

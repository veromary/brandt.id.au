Yesterday we finally made a recording to fill a gap on youtube. This is
a family favourite round for whenever the jubilant mood takes us.

Attributed to Michael Praetorius, a five part canon, sheet music `here`_
- an excerpt from the `New Book of Old Hymns`_. Maybe we can get
recordings for the whole book.

Earlier Patrick and I sang `Ametur`_, two parts out of a three part
motet by Fr Tom Luby. `Sheet music here`_ thanks to Hugh Henry.

`|Proof copy|`_\ The first deadline for getting these books done was
June 2011. Ha ha ha.

This deadline is different. We have the cover done. The photo here is
the last proof copy, but we've lightened and brightened the artwork
since then. The inside is still being fiddled with, but has had a good
trial run at Mulgoa since Christmas 2011.

I had thought of setting up a Pozible kickstarter campaign, but most of
the target audience steers clear of the internet. Also, Pozible runs
"all or nothing" fundraisers - if you don't reach the target you don't
go ahead. These hymnbooks are going ahead regardless. Even if I have to
pay for them myself.

Lots of people have said they would be happy to chip in, some already
have, so now is the time to gather all those together.

`|Excerpt booklets|`_\ Like a kickstarter, I am offering rewards for
donations. I will reserve 40 copies for special benefactors. I will also
make excerpts of the Mass Books available in simple stapled binding. All
these should be available in `the shop`_.

Starting a new web page - or rather, refreshing an old page.

The old version can still be found `here`_. It is a bit broken with
moving to a new server and I'll need to fix up the contact form if
nothing else, but all the old information is there.

The idea is to move all the old stuff into this new thing using
Wordpress as a Content Management System and also finding a way to bring
all these disparate projects together and see if I can make it make
sense.

By this I hope to come to a new understanding of why not everyone goes
in for web publishing.

Happy Good Shepherd Sunday!

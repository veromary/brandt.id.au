There are repositories of music springing up all over the place now!

-  `CPDL`_ - for choral music. `I'm there too`_
-  `Caecilia Project`_
-  `CMAA at Github`_

In case my old stuff is still useful:

-  `Proclamation of moveable feasts for Epiphany`_
-  `A New Book of Old Hymns`_
-  `The Old Gregorian Chant Page`_
-  `The Pilgrim's Primer`_

Jubilate Deo
------------

 

In 1974 Pope Paul VI issued a little booklet called Jubilate Deo.
 It gave a minimum repertoire of Gregorian Chant to be used
 throughout the world. It keeps things really simple.

Using the margin notes capabilities of LaTeX I've tried a
 different way of laying out the page with the latin text in
 the main section and english in the wide margins. The pages are
 a4. You can see the progress so far in `jubilate.pdf`_
 and for the TeXnicians here is the source
 `jubilate.tar.gz`_.

Rosary in Latin
---------------

 

A little card for saying the rosary in latin.
 The chant for the Pater Noster and the Salve Regina is included.
 It doesn't have the English translations.
 Have a look at `rosary.pdf`_ and for the
 TeXnicians `rosary.tar.gz`_.

Mass of the Dead
----------------

 

A mass booklet for a funeral. Needs some work, but its almost there.
 Chant for all the propers and ordinary done.
 Also includes the parts of the Mass. 34 pages
 `dead.pdf`_ and `dead.tar.gz`_

Miscellaneous Pieces
--------------------

 

In the process of adding any music that may be clear of copyright.

I have an informal guitar/recorder/singing class that I arrange music
for.
 The songs are usually very simple with diagrammed chords for the
guitars.

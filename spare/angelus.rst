`|martini-annunciazione|`_\ Traditionally said every day at 6am, 12noon
and 6pm, commemorating the Annunciation of Our Lord by the Angel Gabriel
to Mary. We had this in my primary school - a year six student would
read it out over the public address system everyday at noon. In the
Philippines it would be said over the radio. In medieval times the
church bell would remind people for miles around to take a moment to
pray.

In Easter time it is replaced by Regina Caeli (O Queen of Heaven
rejoice!) which has music, but the rest of the year we usually just say
it.

 Oremus:
 Gratiam tuam, quaesumus, Domine, mentibus nostris infunde; ut qui,
Angelo nuntiante, Christi Filii tui incarnationem cognovimus, per
passionem eius et crucem, ad resurrectionis gloriam perducamur. Per
eundem Christum Dominum nostrum.

℣ The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary;
 ℟ And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.Hail Mary, full of grace, the
Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now, and in the hour of our death. Amen.
 ℣ Behold the handmaid of the Lord:
 ℟ Be it done unto me according to Thy word.
 Hail Mary, full of grace, ...
 ℣ And the Word was made flesh:
 ℟ And dwelt among us.
 Hail Mary, full of grace, ...
 ℣ Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
 ℟ That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
 Let us pray:
 Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that
we, to whom the incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the
message of an angel, may by His passion and cross be brought to the
glory of His resurrection, through the same Christ our Lord.
 ℟ Amen.

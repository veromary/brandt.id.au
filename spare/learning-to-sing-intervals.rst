 School of Intervals`_

Lots of people recommend teaching children solfege - but just what that
involves is a bit woolly. The tricks in the `School of Intervals`_
sounds like a good thing - or is it complicating the process?

I'm scouting around for ideas for tomorrow's Providence Children's
Schola thing - last time at Lewisham!

I have about half an hour, almost once a month - not ideal for training
up a choir, but sort of fun to try out ideas with. It makes me wonder if
I could get a children's choir together - weekly practice for an hour
then get them singing Mass once a month - maybe first Sunday at Mulgoa -
or combined with the existing third Sunday of the month sung Mass. Or
the second Sunday of the month at Lawson - that choir is still keen for
new voices too.

And I've printed out Music First Year by Justine Ward and Elizabeth
Perkins from `The Ward Method`_.

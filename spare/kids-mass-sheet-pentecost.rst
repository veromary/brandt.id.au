`|Pentecost|`_\ Biggest feast of the year after Easter (yes, even bigger
than Christmas!) This picture was scanned in from The Manual of the Holy
Catholic Church from Chicago in the reign of Pope Pius X (1903-1914).

The plan is to make printable Mass sheets for each Sunday with a good
quality black and white picture to colour and some words to trace from
the readings in Latin and English. Maybe a weekly email you could
subscribe to? Would anyone be up for that? Maybe set to go out each
Friday ready for the weekend.

Today you have a choice of two fonts: Jarman - a rounded italic with a
little triangle showing where to start each letter: `Pentecost`_
 And Primer Apples - a more upright style: `Pentecost-pa`_

The Latin broken down:

    et (and) repléti (filled) sunt (they are) omnes (all) Spíritu Sancto
    (Holy Spirit)

the English comes from the Doay Rhiems (Challoner revision)

    and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost

Hope you enjoy them.

`|Easter5|`_

I've had this idea for a while. Our local parish provides coloured
worksheets for children to complete during Mass. They aren't too bad,
but I've been thinking we could do something a little better. Working
with the Latin Mass has the advantage of not having to cater for three
years worth of Sundays (A, B and C). So, here's the challenge. Someone
at Brandt Lab to make a kids sheet each week for the next year. It
should include a colouring picture and some words to trace. I'm using
Christopher Jarman's italic font here.

The first installment: `Easter5`_

Feedback very welcome!

Looks like gregorian chant is on the way out. Interestingly it is more
popular in the Philippines. There is an annual swell of interest towards
the end of the year - maybe in the lead up to Christmas.

Interest in the Latin Mass seems to follow suit, except popularity peaks
in Peru.

Optimists keep speculating about increasing interest in gregorian chant
and the Latin Mass, but it might take something more to get that going.
What do other minority groups do? Do we need some big event? Some big
spectacle? But that's not really what we're about.

But maybe Google Trends is not what we should use to measure success.

On the other hand, prayer and the bible have steady popularity, with
hotspots in Africa.

Maybe I should go do something else for a while...

P.S. Divine Office looks more promising (and seems to beat Liturgy of
the Hours)

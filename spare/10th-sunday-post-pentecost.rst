`|PenteNadal10|`_\ At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to some who
trusted in themselves as just, and despised others. Two men went up into
the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican. The
Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give Thee thanks
that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers; as
also is this publican. I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all
that I possess. And the Publican standing afar off would not so much as
lift up his eyes towards heaven, but struck his breast saying: O God, be
merciful to me a sinner. I say to you, this man went down to his house
justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself
shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

`Pentecost10`_

    Deus, propítius esto mihi peccatóri.

    O God, be merciful to me a sinner.

Have a good weekend!

`|cyclopedia-goodsamaritan-sm|`_\ And turning to his disciples, he said:
Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see. For I say to
you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that
you see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things that you hear,
and have not heard them. And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting
him, and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?

But he said to him: What is written in the law? how readest thou? He
answering, said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart,
and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
mind: and thy neighbour as thyself. And he said to him: Thou hast
answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he willing to justify
himself, said to Jesus: And who is my neighbour? And Jesus answering,
said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among
robbers, who also stripped him, and having wounded him went away,
leaving him half dead.

And it chanced, that a certain priest went down the same way: and seeing
him, passed by. In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place
and saw him, passed by. But a certain Samaritan being on his journey,
came near him; and seeing him, was moved with compassion. And going up
to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him
upon his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And the
next day he took out two pence, and gave to the host, and said: Take
care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my
return, will repay thee.

Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell
among the robbers? But he said: He that shewed mercy to him. And Jesus
said to him: Go, and do thou in like manner.

Vade, et fac similiter.

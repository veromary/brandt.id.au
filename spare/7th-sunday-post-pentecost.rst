|sermononmount|\ Another Gospel from the Sermon on the Mount.

    A frúctibus eórum cognoscétis eos.

    By their fruits you shall know them.

At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: Beware of false prophets, who
come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves. By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good
fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot
bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down, and
shall be cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits you shall know
them. Not every one that saith to Me: Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father who is in
heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.

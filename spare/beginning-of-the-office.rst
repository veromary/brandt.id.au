We begin the day with Prime from the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin
Mary and end with Compline from the Liber Usualis (1962).

Praying in Latin is great. The music is wonderful-not schmaltzy, not
obvious. The main drawback is in understanding the words. Today I'm
hoping to get my children to run through these matching quizzes to see
what they make of the now familiar opening versicles of the Divine
Office.

Fr Edward Caswall was a quiet hero of the Oxford Movement who translated
hymns and authored a few of his own too. He also wrote `The Catholic's
Latin Instructor`_.

The book is a series of fairly dull exercises consisting of putting
together the Latin from the Mass and other popular devotions with their
English translations. It does include a short Latin Grammar, but much is
just a straight patching of Latin onto English. Sections are designed to
cater for different groups of the faithful - one for servers, another
for choirs, though there's nothing to stop you going through all the
sections.

Because of this correspondence between the Latin and the English it
lends itself to flash card programs like Hot Potatoes, Quizlet.com and
Anki.

Today I'm having a go at embedding a Quizlet deck into this post,
without much success so far, but I'll leave my attempt here and go make
dinner.

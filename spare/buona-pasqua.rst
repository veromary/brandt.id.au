|Easter baking|\ Portugese Sweet Bread (Folar Pascoa) and carob muffins.
Happy Easter!

A while ago we had a possum dragging a trap attached to its leg. Peter
managed to get the trap off and the possum fled. Today it visited us -
the leg is something of a black stump, but looks like we may see more of
it yet (and maybe get some pictures. So far we just have a picture of
the trap.

The sweet bread worked out well. I used raw eggs instead of boiled eggs
and they cooked well in the oven. When we peeled the eggs we found the
whites of the eggs had discoloured where the eggs stuck out of the
bread. Next time I'll cover the eggs with strips of dough like in `this
recipe for Folar da Pascoa`_. Still good to eat.

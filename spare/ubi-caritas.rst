Here's the page from my hymnbook: `ubicaritas`_. I haven't forgotten
about making it available. The latest development has been putting it up
`GitHub`_.

I'm having trouble finding the ideal recording. Yes, I should have got
my family to sing it, but they're all in bed, approximately, and I want
to get this done tonight, and lots of kids with sore throats right now
anyway, so here's the closest. The monks are singing the possibly more
correct words "Ubi caritas est vera" (where charity is true) but the
screen still gives the more widespread "Ubi caritas et amor" (where
charity and love are). The `New Book of Old Hymns`_ uses the vera
version, but the excerpt above uses the amor version.

For lyrics and translation see `Thesaurus Precum Latinarum`_. (Thesaurus
means Treasury - isn't that cool?)

And when you have enjoyed the straight chant version, check out the
Durufle version and the one from the Royal Wedding. Lots of beautiful
arrangments out there. I remember hearing one on the radio, a rather
modern one, but it generally moved from dissonance towards a melody
rather like the regular chant version. I haven't been able to track it
down, so please jump in and comment if you have any clues.

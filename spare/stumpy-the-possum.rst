`|DSC01336|`_\ The story so far: one Sunday morning a few weeks ago we
heard the rattling of chains and found a possum hiding under the house
with a leg caught in a steel trap. We didn't set the trap, don't know
where it came from. Peter released the possum.

A while after that we found a mother and baby possum exploring our
barbeque, clanging the gas tank. Surprisingly they didn't run when we
went out to see what the noise was about. Even when we tried to
encourage them to go elsewhere, they still hung around. We didn't see
the leg that time.

`|DSC01337|`_\ Then we saw the mother possum emerge from under the shed
during the day time. The baby followed after. And then we saw the leg,
or what was left of it. So this was the possum from the trap, and she
had a baby.

`|DSC01338|`_\ She came out again this morning while we were hanging out
the washing (or rather Patrick hanging out the washing, me holding
Elizabeth and taking photos of the possum) The baby possum stuck his
head out for a little while but didn't get a good photo.

`|stumpy|`_\ So it looks like we have a friendly possum or two. And
something has eaten all our geranium leaves. And parsley.

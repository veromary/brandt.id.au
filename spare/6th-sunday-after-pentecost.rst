`|The Miracle of the Loaves, by William Hole|`_\ At that time, when
there was a great multitude with Jesus, and they had nothing to eat,
calling His disciples together, He saith to them: I have compassion on
the multitude, for behold they have now been with Me three days, and
have nothing to eat; and if I shall send them away fasting to their
home, they will faint in the way: for some of them came from afar off.
And His disciples answered Him: From whence can any one fill them here
with bread in the wilderness? And He asked them: How many loaves have
ye? Who said: Seven. And He commanded the people to sit down on the
ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, He broke and gave to
His disciples to set before the people. And they had a few little
fishes, and He blessed them, and commanded them to be set before them.
And they did eat, and were filled; and they took up that which was left
of the fragments, seven baskets: and they that had eaten were about four
thousand: and He sent them away.

`|WilliamHole|`_ Looking through my books here, I don't have a colouring
in type picture, but lots of pictures of paintings. This book, **The
Life of Jesus of Nazareth Portayed in Colours** is fantastic and the
artist `William Hole RSA`_ died in 1918 so probably Public Domain.

The gospel reading for EF Masses this Sunday is Luke 5:

`|Pente4colour2|`_

    And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to
    hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth, [2] And
    saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out
    of them, and were washing their nets. [3] And going into one of the
    ships that was Simon' s, he desired him to draw back a little from
    the land. And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the ship. [4]
    Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into
    the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. [5] And Simon
    answering said to him: Master, we have labored all the night, and
    have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.

    [6] And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great
    multitude of fishes, and their net broke. [7] And they beckoned to
    their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come
    and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that
    they were almost sinking. [8] Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell
    down at Jesus' knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man,
    O Lord. [9] For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with
    him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken. [10] And so
    were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon' s
    partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear not: from henceforth thou
    shalt catch men.

    [11] And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things,
    they followed him.

`|Pente4Sepia2|`_\ The next one comes from another book, Christ's Life
In Pictures by Rev George A Keith. "This Book Is Never Sold - It is
given only with subscription to `EXTENSION MAGAZINE`_" There is no date
to the book, but the endorsements from Cardinal Gibbons and Cardinal
Farley put it before 1918. There are also no references for where the
paintings come from.

`|Pente4Nadal|`_\ So for this weeks worksheet I'll go back to
`Illustrations of Gospel Stories from Jerome Nadal, S.J.`_ -
`Pentecost4.pdf`_. Clicking on the picture gets a big version which
makes a good print out by itself.

Duc in altum. Launch out into the deep.

De copiosa capturam piscium. The big catch of fish.

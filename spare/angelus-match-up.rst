Playing with `Hot Potatoes`_ again.

And if the little frame there is too small, `here`_ is the full screen
version.

I probably should have split up the Angelus into six parts rather than
just four. But for now see what you think.

Next puzzle is where to put these puzzles - repleatur, or their own
website?

`|St Peter Julian Eymard|`_\ **Hymn of the week, Latin and English.**

Today I am spurred on to promote devotion to Jesus in the Blessed
Sacrament. This time of the year the Church celebrates the feast of
Corpus Christi, the Body and Blood of Our Lord. In Sydney this Sunday
hundreds, if not thousands of people will process through the streets in
a huge Eucharistic procession called `Walk With Christ`_. This is all a
drop in the ocean compared to the love he pours out for us, a love which
is all too often ignored, even ridiculed.

The writer of this hymn is St Thomas Aquinas, whose whole life is worth
reading, but this one episode stands out to me:

    ...towards the end of his life, when at Salerno he was laboring over
    the third part of his great treatise, *Against the Pagans (Summa
    Contra Gentiles)*, dealing with Christ's Passion and Resurrection, a
    sacristan saw him late one night kneeling before the altar and heard
    a voice, coming, it seemed, from the crucifix, which said, "Thou
    hast written well of Me, Thomas; what reward wouldst thou have?" To
    which Thomas replied, "Nothing but Thyself, Lord."
     read more at `EWTN, Lives of the Saints, St Thomas Aquinas`_

Nothing but Thyself.

Sacrament.

1. Adoro te devote, latens Deitas,
 Quæ sub his figuris vere latitas;
 Tibi se cor meum totum subjicit,
 Quia te contemplans totum deficit.

2. Visus, tactus, gustus in te fallitur,
 Sed auditu solo tuto creditur.
 Credo quidquid dixit Dei Filius;
 Nil hoc verbo veritátis verius.

3. In cruce latebat sola Deitas,
 At hic latet simul et Humanitas,
 Ambo tamen credens atque confitens,
 Peto quod petivit latro pœnitens.

4. Plagas, sicut Thomas, non intueor:
 Deum tamen meum te confiteor.
 Fac me tibi semper magis credere,
 In te spem habere, te diligere.

5. O memoriale mortis Domini!
 Panis vivus, vitam præstans homini!
 Præsta meæ menti de te vívere,
 Et te illi semper dulce sapere.

6. Pie Pelicane, Jesu Domine,
 Me immundum munda tuo sanguine:
 Cujus una stilla salvum facere
 Totum mundum quit ab omni scelere.

7. Jesu, quem velatum nunc aspicio,
 Oro, fiat illud quod tam sitio:
 Ut te revelata cernens facie,
 Visu sim beátus tuæ gloriæ. Amen

1. Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore,
 Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more,
 See, Lord, at Thy service low lies here a heart
 Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art.

   </p>

2. Seeing, touching, tasting are in Thee deceived:
 How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;
 What God's Son has told me, take for truth I do;
 Truth Himself speaks truly or there's nothing true.

3. On the cross Thy godhead made no sign to men,
 Here Thy very manhood steals from human ken:
 Both are my confession, both are my belief,
 And I pray the prayer of the dying thief.

4. I am not like Thomas, wounds I cannot see,
 But can plainly call Thee Lord and God as he;
 This faith each day deeper be my holding of,
 Daily make me harder hope and dearer love.

5. O Thou our reminder of Christ crucified,
 Living Bread, the life of us for whom He died,
 Lend this life to me then: feed and feast my mind,
 There be Thou the sweetness man was meant to find.

6. Like what tender tales tell of the Pelican;
 Bathe me, Jesu Lord, in what Thy bosom ran---
 Blood whereof a single drop has power to win
 All the world forgiveness of its world of sin.

7. Jesu, whom I look at shrouded here below,
 I beseech Thee send me what I thirst for so,
 Some day to gaze on Thee face to face in light
 And be blest for ever with Thy glory's sight. Amen.

Written by `St Thomas Aquinas`_ O.P. about 800 years ago. Translated by
Gerard Manley Hopkins S.J. about 150 years ago.

Looking for a youtube clip with the English translation by Gerard Manley
Hopkins there doesn't seem to be one. Adoremus has a recording of the
first verse `Here`_ (see number 511). Or me singing it : `Godhead`_

But there's still the beautiful original in Latin:

**Sheet music:**

Organ music to print: `AdoroTe`_ and `Godhead`_

Lilypond code for editing: `AdoroTe`_ `Godhead`_

Luke 19[/caption]This Sunday's reading is a tricky one. Is Our Lord
encouraging embezzlement?

I can't find a particular colour page. This parable fits between the
Good Samaritan and No Man Can Serve Two Masters. The latter brings in
some flack from the Pharisees, so I figured this picture will do, though
I don't think he was actually teaching in the temple this time.

Here is the printable colouring page: `Pentecost08`_ - using Fr Nadal's
work again.

    recípiant vos in ætérna tabernácula.

    they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.

`|Pente08Nadal|`_\ At that time, Jesus spoke to His disciples this
parable: There was a certain rich man who had a steward; and the same
was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods; and he called him,
and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of
thy stewardship, for now thou canst be steward no longer. And the
steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh
away from me the stewardship? To dig, I am not able: to beg, I am
ashamed. I know what I will do, that when I shall be put out of the
stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. Therefore calling
together every one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first: How much
dost thou owe my lord? But he said: A hundred barrels of oil. And he
said to him: Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. Then
he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: A hundred
quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty. And
the lord commended the unjust steward, for as much as he had done
wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation
than the children of light. And I say to you: Make unto you friends of
the mammon of iniquity, that when you shall fail, they may receive you
into everlasting dwellings.

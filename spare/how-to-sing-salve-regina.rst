|Mary|\ The most celebrated of the four Breviary anthems of the Blessed
Virgin Mary. It is said from the First Vespers of Trinity Sunday until
None of the Saturday before Advent. The authorship is now generally
ascribed to Hermann Contractus. (from the `Cathiolic Encyclopedia`_)

The one thing people keep asking is to learn the Salve Regina. Ideally
you'd want some monks to sing it for you a few times a day. Maybe for
morning prayers, after the Rosary (it is the Hail Holy Queen in Latin)
and at night time prayers before bed.

Failing that, there's youtube:

`Here is the link`_ in case the former link doesn't work. And another if
the sidescrolling music makes you dizzy `here is another version`_.

Play with the vocabulary on `Quizlet`_.

Print `salve`_ fromm `A New Book Of Old Hymns`_ and sing along.

For downloadable mp3s see `Selected Chants from St Benedict's, Sao
Paolo, Brazil`_, `Latin Mass Society Chant Downloads`_ (scroll down to
Other Chant) and `Adoremus Hymnal at Ignatius Press`_ (scroll down to
number 545).

There is a solemn version of Salve Regina at `Wikimedia Commons`_ in ogg
format. For your mp3 player you might use this:
`Petits\_Chanteurs\_de\_Passy\_-\_Salve\_Regina\_de\_Hermann\_Contract.mp3`_.

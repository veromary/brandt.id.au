`|CatechisminPcs56|`_\ The words for this hymn are found in Cardinal
Newman's poem the `Dream of Gerontius`_. It is the prayer of a soul
preparing for death. Later in the poem the angels sing another of
Cardinal Newman's famous hymns, Praise to the Holiest. It is a fantastic
read.

It also gives something like a chorus to this hymn:

    Sanctus fortis, Sanctus Deus,
     De profundis oro te,
     Miserere, Judex meus,
     Parce mihi, Domine.

This chorus is given first and last and in the middle. A rough
translation would be Holy Mighty One, Holy God, out of the depths I cry
to There. Have Mercy, my Judge, spare me, Lord.

Edward Elgar made the poem into an oratorio, which is why most places
use his tune, Drakes Broughton. It can be a majestic tune, but can be
prone to plodding or even dragging.

I have enjoyed singing Firmly I Believe to the tune some call Omni Die,
which sounds like a reference to the popular Marian hymn, Daily, daily
sing to Mary.  Here's my easy organ music:

-  Elgar's tune: `elgarFirmly.pdf`_\ `(lilypond source elgarFirmly.ly)`_
   - youtube clip `here`_
-  More lively tune: `FirmlyChords.pdf`_ (lilypond source
   `FirmlyChords.ly`_) - hear the tune played better `here`_
-  `Small Church Music`_ has another tune called Sharon.

However you sing it, call to mind the profession of faith of a soul on
the brink of eternity.

    Firmly I believe and truly
     God is Three, and God is One;
     And I next acknowledge duly
     Manhood taken by the Son.

    And I trust and hope most fully
     In that manhood crucified;
     And each thought and deed unruly
     Do to death, as He has died.

    Simply to His grace and wholly
     Light and life and strength belong,
     And I love supremely, solely,
     Him the holy, Him the strong.

    And I hold in veneration,
     For the love of Him alone,
     Holy Church as His creation,
     And her teachings are His own.

    And I take with joy whatever
     Now besets me, pain or fear,
     And with a strong will I sever
     All the ties which bind me here.

    Adoration aye be given,
     With and through the angelic host,
     To the God of earth and Heaven,
     Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

That second last verse is often left out - it's more specific to the
departing soul.

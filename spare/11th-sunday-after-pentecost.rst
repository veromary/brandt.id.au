`|Blind-MChalmers-sm|`_\ This colour illustration is from The Bible
Picture Book by Muriel Chalmers. I can't find the Rev. Hole book this
afternoon. Hopefully it will turn up soon!

At that time, Jesus going out of the coasts of Tyre, came by Sidon to
the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. And
they bring to Him one deaf and dumb, and they besought Him that He would
lay His hand upon him. And taking him from the multitude apart, He put
His fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue; and
looking up to heaven, He groaned and said to him: Ephphetha, which is,
Be thou opened: and immediately his ears were opened, and the string of
his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right. And He charged them that they
should tell no man: but the more He charged them so much the more a
great deal did they publish it; and so much the more did they wonder,
saying: He hath done all things well; He hath made both the deaf to hear
and the dumb to speak.

 εφφαθα

`|Gian\_Lorenzo\_Bernini\_-\_Dove\_of\_the\_Holy\_Spirit|`_\ Good old
hymn to the Holy Ghost. Great for just about every special occasion -
confirmations, ordinations, baptisms, weddings, any time you pray for a
blessing!

Here is my one page special sheet music: `venicreator.pdf`_.

And here are the words:

    1. Veni, creator Spiritus
     mentes tuorum visita,
     imple superna gratia,
     quae tu creasti pectora.

    2. Qui diceris Paraclitus,
     altissimi donum Dei,
     fons vivus, ignis, caritas
     et spiritalis unctio.

    3. Tu septiformis munere,
     digitus paternae dexterae
     tu rite promissum Patris
     sermone ditans guttura.

    4. Accende lumen sensibus,
     infunde amorem cordibus,
     infirma nostri corporis,
     virtute firmans perpeti.

    5. Hostem repellas longius
     pacemque dones protinus;
     ductore sic te praevio
     vitemus omne noxium.

    6. Per te sciamus da Patrem
     noscamus atque Filium,
     te utriusque Spiritum
     credamus omni tempore.

    7. Deo Patri sit gloria,
     et Filio qui a mortuis
     Surrexit, ac Paraclito,
     in saeculorum saecula.
     Amen.

There are two popular translations that I know of. `Come Holy Ghost,
Creator Come`_ - in a nice steady 86.86 rhythm and `Come Holy Ghost,
Creator Blest`_ in 88.88 like the original Latin. They are both really
beautiful. Both worth planting in your memory.

The `Choral Public Domain Library`_ has more information, including a
link to the `Catholic Encyclopedia article`_ which gives the first part
of `John Dryden's translation`_.

Lastly, there is `another version`_ of the Latin `sung by Giovanni
Vianini's choirs`_. This is the one found in the Monastic Antiphonale,
used by Benedictine monasteries. The story of why there are two versions
of so many hymns can be read: `URBAN VIII AND THE REVISION OF THE LATIN
HYMNAL by Vincent A. Lenti`_. Basically, we had all these hymns for a
thousand years or so, then in the 1500s, the humanist Pope Urban VIII
thought "that the old hymns were rather tasteless and inelegant and
could be improved with a reworking of the Latin texts". The Benedictines
and other groups (including the Vatican) got permission to stick with
the old hymns, so that's why they're in the Monastic books. The rest of
the Roman Rite got the humanist "improved" versions. One of the
wonderful changes with the whole recent overhaul of the liturgy was
undoing Pope Urban VIII's changes and going back to the original hymns.
Unfortunately, the Extraordinary Form uses 1962 books, which still have
the "improved" humanist versions. So that's what I've given here.

    "Ambrose and Prudentius took something classical and made it
    Christian; the revisers and their imitators took something Christian
    and tried to make it classical. The result may be pedantry, and
    sometimes perhaps poetry; but it is not piety." -- Rev. Joseph
    Connelly in *Hymns of the Roman Liturgy*, The Newmann Press, West
    minster, Maryland, 1957.

God has it all fixed up in heaven.

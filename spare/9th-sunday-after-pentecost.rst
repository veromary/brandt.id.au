`|WHole020|`_\ When I went to get this week's illustration from William
Hole's *The Life of Jesus of Nazareth*. The reading for this week
corresponds with the picture of Jesus teaching in the temple that I
picked `last week!`_ But not to worry. This weeks picture is near the
beginning of the Public Ministry according to John's Gospel. Today's
reading is from Luke again:

At that time, when Jesus drew near to Jerusalem, seeing the city, He
wept over it saying: If thou also hadst known, and that in this day, the
things that are to thy peace: but now they are hidden from thy eyes. For
the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about
thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side; and beat
thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee; and they
shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone, because thou hast not
known the time of thy visitation. And entering into the temple, He began
to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought, saying to
them: It is written, My house is the house of prayer, but you have made
it a den of thieves. And He was teaching daily in the temple.

    Quia domus mea domus orati√≥nis est.

    My house is the house of prayer.

Nadal's picture is great, as usual. I like the line for label B: Christi
splendor e vultu & maiestas quae terret omnes. Something like "the
splendor of Christ's face/countenance strikes terror into all". Yes, I
need to study more.

Yes, the astute reader will notice this is for Feria III post Dominica I
in Quadragesimae (Tuesday after the first Sunday of Lent). Same picture
so Felix Just only put up the one.

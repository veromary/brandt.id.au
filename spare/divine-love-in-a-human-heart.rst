This is a hymn by `James McAuley`_, so I should ask permission before
posting lyrics. There once was a webpage with all his poetry online by
arrangement with `the estate`_, but looks like it closed.

The music is by `Richard Connolly`_.

It is in the old Living Parish Hymnbooks and Hymns for the Year of
Faith. I'd love to see these reprinted.

Begging your pardon for not posting regularly.

I have half a mind to go back to a static website, maybe along the lines
of `veromary.github.io`_.

Peter is selling portraits on `ebay`_ and `etsy`_.

Boys have had a go at `DIY.org`_. You can see their work `here`_ and
`here`_ and `here`_ and `here`_.

I'm still blogging for `ccwatershed.org`_.

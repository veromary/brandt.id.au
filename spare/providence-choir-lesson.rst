About once a month we head down to the Providence Homeschoolers group
for a Latin Choir.

Much of the time I'm not that organised, and just wing it. But recently
the `CMAA`_ brought out a book especially for teaching Gregorian Chant
to children called `Words with Wings`_. Best of all, it is published
under a Creative Commons license, so I can use bits here, as long as I
attribute them.

So here goes.

First for the pre-readers and those who weren't here for all the other
times I went through the scale.

For the clever clogs who can read, here is class handout: `Solfege.pdf`_
 and here are the answers, just in case: `Solfege-answers.pdf`_

The handout includes:

#. A worksheet on solfege (do re mi)
#. A special bonus page for students who catch on.
#. The first verse of hymn *Puer natus*. Music and vocabulary.
#. The second verse of the same.
#. The words of all seven verses in Latin and English

Here's the vocabulary to learn for the first verse:

And the second verse too:

But the main thing is to learn to sing the hymn. As explained in the
handout, you can go to `Words with Wings`_ to hear each verse read out
and also sung by a children's choir.

Here's a quick quiz to see if you know your do re mi:

This is an experimental sort of thing - seeing if it's quicker to google
for an answer or just try things out yourself.

::

    <a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/corjesumatch.htm">corjesumatch</a>

`corjesumatch`_

So that's like an external link which might work.

It doesn't look very embeddable - a whole long javascript thing as well
as a lot of style stuff.

Unless the iframe trick works

::

    <iframe src="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/corjesumatch.htm" height="400" width="400"></iframe>

And to put code in a wordpress post - start in text mode: make a
placeholder like this

::

    <pre>

    </pre>

Then select and Ctrl-C your code. Switch to visual mode and paste it in
the placeholder space.

Then before we go, try another hotpotato alternative: test out WP Survey
& Quiz Plugin (click the "Next" button to try a silly quiz.)

[wpsqt name="Test run" type="quiz"]

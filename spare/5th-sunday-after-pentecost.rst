`|sermon on the mount|`_\ The sermon on the mount. Plate 28 by William
Hole RSA. Always associated with the Beatitudes.

Today's Gospel focusses on another part of the discourse - the warning
against bearing anger. No matter how long you nurse a grudge, it doesn't
get better. A good admonition on approaching the altar too. The
disciples on Mt Thabor would have understood him in the context of the
temple sacrifices. Today it seems to point to preparing for Communion -
but could go for any prayer. And since we should pray always, we need to
forgive always.

Here is the text of the day's Gospel:

`|image1|`_ At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: Except your
justice abound more than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to
them of old: Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill, shall be in
danger of the judgment. But I say to you, that whosoever is angry with
his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say
to his brother: Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever
shall say: Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. If therefore thou
offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother
hath anything against thee, leave there thy offering before the altar,
and go first to be reconciled to thy brother; and then coming thou shalt
offer thy gift

    vade prius reconciliari fratri tuo:

    go first to be reconciled to thy brother

And here is the copywork/colouring in page to print out:

`Pentecost05`_

`|Pente05Nadal|`_\ Next is Fr Nadal's illustration - Jesus talking with
the disciples with five vignettes in the clouds above. Murder, slander,
court, fire breathing dragon and the man leaving his gift at the altar
to go be reconciled.

Anger should be restrained, Compescitur iracundia. From `Gospel
Illustrations by Jerome Nadal SJ`_.

Thanks for reading. God bless you and I hope you have a great weekend.

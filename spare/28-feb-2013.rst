Singing
=======

We've seen the music above. Here are some recordings to help you
remember the tunes.

The round, Da Pacem, is shown under `Children's choir`_

And here is the simple chant antiphon, Parce Domine:

Music theory
============

Can I assume everyone knows Do Re Mi? Here's the refresher course from
Julie Andrews:

In gregorian chant we use these names for the notes instead of the
letters you learn when you're playing an instrument. We use four lines
to put the notes on and we pick one line to be "Do" and count up and
down from there.

The Do line is marked with the Do clef or C clef.\ `|doclef|`_. Any
notes on that line are do on the scale.

Most people know how to sing the ascending scale. (Ascending means going
up) This is good. In chant though we usually put the do clef near the
top, so you need to learn to sing the descending scale (going down).
Fortunately this is really easy as the notes are the same as singing
"Joy to the world, the Lord is come". Try singing that with the note
names.

[caption id="attachment\_537"]\ `|do ti la sol to colour in|`_ The
descending scale to colour in.[/caption]

Count up the scale to name these notes:
 Do: |dodo| Re: |dore|
 Mi: |domi|

Count down the scale to name these notes:
 Do; |image6| Ti: |doti|
 La: |dola| So: |doso| Fa: |dofa|

There is one more thing to learn. As well as the do clef there is a fa
clef. You can probably guess from the name this symbol marks the line
for the note fa.

Fa on the fa clef |fafa|\ and do on the fa clef |fado|

Click on this picture for a printable page to name each note:
 `|test|`_
 And here are the answers: `test`_

Practice what you've learnt with this applet. Click the notes to see the
name of the note and hear the sound.

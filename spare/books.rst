`A New Book of Old Hymns`_
 |book cover|\ The impetus for this book came from attending
the \ `Maternal Heart of Mary Church`_ where they had all this beautiful
music in latin and I wanted to know what it all meant. Most of it is
Gregorian Chant, but there are some of the simpler polyphonic pieces
here and there. It is a handy book for teaching young choirs. Some
pieces can be sung in either Latin or English.

The typesetting was done in the older package called OpusTeX – those
with an eye for detail may note the difference with the more recent
booklets on this blog. The hymn numbers were more of an after-thought,
but have been used in a parish setting as hymnbooks.

Paperback 92pp. $12

**Reprints of classic Catholic hymnbooks**

`Old Westminster Hymnal`_
 |image1|\ A hymnbook compiled by Richard Terry, choirmaster of
Westminster Cathedral when it first opened. The book is subtitled “The
Only Collection Authorized by the Hierarchy of England and Wales”. The
story of how this hierarchy was re-established after so many years of
suppression after the reformation is worth looking into.

The hymns are painstakingly researched to find the most authentic
melodies – read the Musical Editor’s Preface for a fine discussion of
the different variations across England in different hymns.

The book was gleaned from the Internet Archive and supplemented with
pages scanned from a later edition – handy indices.

1912, Paperback 431pp. $20

`Treasury of Catholic Song`_
 |image2|\ This book is fun to browse. The editor Fr Hurlbut was from
Maryland, USA, but also had spent time in Europe. It is the easiest to
read and generally runs three verses worth of text under the music
before printing any extra stanzas afterwards. The editor was an
engraver, which might explain the better design of the book. He draws
from Arundel Hymns and the Westminster Hymnal as well as many other
sources.

There is a generous selection of tunes for the O Salutaris Hostia and
Tantum Ergo for Benediction.

1915, Paperback 311pp. $18

`St Basil’s Hymnal 1918`_
 |image3|
 This one has been quite popular and there have been many editions over
the years. This edition was the first to be really tidied up, newly
typeset to be more easily read with numbering to leave room for
expansion in future editions with some backwards compatibility.

The hymns were selected by a committee so tend towards the popular and
sentimental sort, which have their place. It was published in Canada by
the Basilian Fathers. It has a mixture of different sorts of hymns along
with some Mass settings.

Paperback 351pp, $20

`Arundel Hymns`_
 |image4|
 This book I love. It was put together by a Duke and a scholar so you
get amazing historical treasures and all these great gems. It is more of
a treasure trove than a hymnbook. It includes poetry without any attempt
to match a tune. There are hymns for everything – even before and after
meals.

It is an English book and includes lots from the Oratorians, especially
Fr E Caswall and Blessed Cardinal Newman. Fr. John O’Connor is in there
too – another great hymnist if I can call him that. He is credited with
inspiring the Fr Brown of G K Chesterton’s short detective stories. The
book features a frontispiece to the memory of the Earl of Arundel who
died in the persecution of the Catholic Church. The book came at a time
when the Church was just emerging from centuries of suppression. With
the government finally allowing new Catholic churches to be built, the
editor of this book also started work on the church pictured on the
front cover which is now the Cathedral.

Paperback 574pp, $24

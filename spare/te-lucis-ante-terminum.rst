`|flyingsouth|`_\ Each night our family sings Compline, the night time
prayers of the Church. We learnt the way from the `Maternal Heart
Church`_. Since then they have shifted to singing the Divine Office from
the Benedictine books, so they have slightly different words and tunes.
Here is the Roman one that most 1962 books use. In 1974 there was yet
another change.

The hymn for Compline is very beautiful. The prayers to ward off bad
dreams are helpful when getting children off to bed. Each new season
brings a new tune, the words staying the same. They're all pretty
simple, as you don't need complicated stuff to learn just before bed!

John Mason Neale's translation runs thus:

    To Thee, before the close of day
     Creator of the world, we pray
     that with Thy wonted favor, Thou
     wouldst be our Guard and Keeper now.

    From all ill dreams defend our eyes,
     from nightly fears and fantasies:
     tread under foot our ghostly foe,
     that no pollution we may know.

    O Father, that we ask be done
     through Jesus Christ Thine only Son,
     who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
     shall live and reign eternally.
     Amen.

For lyrics in Latin and English go to `Te lucis at Thesaurus Precum
Latinarum`_.

The tune I've got here today is the regular Sunday and other minor
feasts tune you can use most of the time. `Here's a pdf`_, mostly taken
from `GregoBase`_.

Here is how we sing it: `telucis.mp3`_ [audio:

And here is the serious rendition with the music scrolling past.

It's a start.

So I guess you start with punctums, moving up to a complete scale. Then
introduce the podatus. Make an online songbook of the Marian Antiphons,
Simple Tone - would you click each neume to play it, or just sit back
and watch each neume light up?

And the beauty of it is that you can install Scratch yourself, download
my project and use it as the basis of your own work. Which is also how
the `Hymnbook`_ is supposed to work, but Scratch is colourful and easy
to use - aimed at children.

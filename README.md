============

My beloved first domain - a sandpit for family stuff.

In former years I used [gtml](http://gtml.sourceforge.net/) to put together a static website.

Then there was Wordpress and that was fun for me, but my shared hosting was not amused.

Now I'm steering back to a static website, this time with Jekyll.

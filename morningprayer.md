#Morning Prayer

###Morning Offering

O my Jesus, through the most pure heart of Mary, I offer Thee all my prayers, works, joys and sufferings of this day, for all the intentions of Thy Divine Heart.

Angel of God, my guardian dear
To whom God's Love commits me here
Ever this day be at my side
To light and guard, to rule and guide.  Amen.

###Act of Faith

O my God, I firmly believe all the truths which the Holy Catholic Church believes and teaches.  I believe these truths, O Lord, because Thou, the infallible Truth, hast revealed them to her. In this faith I am resolved to live and die. Amen.

###Act of Hope

O my God, relying on thy promises, I hope that, through the infinite merits of Jesus Christ, Thou wilt grant me pardon of my sins and the grace necessary to serve Thee in this life and obtain eternal happiness in the next. Amen.


###Act of Love

O my God, I love Thee with my whole heart and above all things because Thou art infinitely good and perfect, and I love my neighbour as myself for love of Thee.  Grant that I may love thee more and more in this life and in the next for all eternity.  Amen.

###Act of Contrition

O my God, I am sorry and beg pardon for all my sins, and detest them above all things, because they deserve Thy dreadful punishments, because they have crucified my loving Saviour Jesus Christ, and, most of all, because they offind Thine Infinite goodness; and I firmly resolve by the help of Thy grace never to offend Thee again, and carefully to avoid the occasions of sin. Amen.
